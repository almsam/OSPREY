2. **Supportive Culture**:  
   Try to help others whenever you can. We're here to learn and grow together. If someone asks a question that you think is "dumb", DO NOT make fun of or ridicule them, be nice and just answer or ignore it for someone else. We are here to promote learning and keep people as interested as possible, not to discourage anyone from contributing.

    - In the cases of *Transgender & Gender Diverse* folks, misgendering or unsolicited speech on their identities is never tolerated.
    - In cases of *Racialized* folks, any speech that is discriminatory in nature towards immigrants, differing cultures, or different ethnicities is never tolerated.

    - Uses of Slurs or any inappropriate speech is never tolerated
    - Discussion of political topics are generally frowned upon within OSPREY spaces, & are encouraged to be directed to the appropriate time & place. Should an OSPREY member decide to partake in political speech they shall do so in a respectful way & at their own risk.
