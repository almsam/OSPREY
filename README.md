## About this project

OSPREY is an open-source initiative designed to give contributors—especially fresh graduates and early-career developers—a structured opportunity to gain real-world project experience. In exchange for a weekly time commitment, volunteers collaborate on bite‑sized open-source projects, get practical coding & project‑management practice, and contribute to education & research in the computer science network.


## How It Works

1. **Intake & Matching**  
   - Fill out our [OSPREY Intake Form](https://forms.gle/7pdDQtkV4XDXB1TE9) to share your background, confidence areas, and interests - choose your focus areas & Indicate whether you’d like work as a Developer or Project manager

2. **Project Assignment**  
   - Developers are paired with small, well-scoped repositories aligned to their skill levels - optimizing to both improve existing skills & develop new ones.  
   - Project Managers are engineers in charge of proposing new & existing OSPREY projects ensuring the developers are on the right track

3. **Weekly Check‑Ins**  
   - Devs & PM's log their hours in our weekly form to verify progress. [OSPREY Weekly Form](https://forms.gle/)
   - PMs communicate directly to devs on updates, on scope, progress, & deliverables.
   - The above is reviewed by an OSPREY Admin to verify operations are up to standard
