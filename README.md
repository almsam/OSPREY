## About this project

OSPREY is an open-source initiative designed to give contributors—especially fresh graduates and early-career developers—a structured opportunity to gain real-world project experience. In exchange for a weekly time commitment, volunteers collaborate on bite‑sized open-source projects, get practical coding & project‑management practice, and contribute to education & research in the computer science network.

## How It Works

1. **Intake & Matching**

   - Fill out our [OSPREY Intake Form](https://forms.gle/7pdDQtkV4XDXB1TE9) to share your background, confidence areas, and interests - choose your focus areas & Indicate whether you’d like work as a Developer or Project manager
2. **Project Assignment**

   - Developers are paired with small, well-scoped repositories aligned to their skill levels - optimizing to both improve existing skills & develop new ones.
   - Project Managers are engineers in charge of proposing new & existing OSPREY projects ensuring the developers are on the right track
3. **Weekly Check‑Ins**

   - Devs & PM's log their hours in our weekly form to verify progress. [OSPREY Weekly Form](https://forms.gle/wmjEshBNJuuK4ZTt8)
