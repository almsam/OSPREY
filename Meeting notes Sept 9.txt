	code quality: adequate

	punctuality: adequate

	greater image: lack of context, more doccumentation? use?

	preference: no change

	feadback: doccumentation was lacking - issues need description

Charles:

	code quality: not bad - functionally perfect

	punctuality: not bad - excused absense

	greater image: picked up small pieces, not much overall

	preference: shift to scientific computation, improved in stats due to cross training

	feadback: branch naming convetion {IE setup/_ or docs/_ } - cleaner repos overall, directory is messy
